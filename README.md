## My process

Hello, this is my seventh challenge here in frontend mentor. This custom chat app was pretty fun to create since you make it from scratch. I dint't use any external source just pure css and js^

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javscript
- FlexBox
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

This challenge made me more proud of what I can create using just css to style without having to use any other components^

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
